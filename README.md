•	This is the learning assistant which parses sentences for matching keywords os synonyms. To begin you must first download the eclipse IDE from https://eclipse.org/downloads/
•	After downloading the IDE from the above website, launch eclipse. Then after the program is launched go to File > Import. Select Existing projects into Workspace.

•	Then browse for the 377finalproject folder. After you select it you click on finish and you are good to go. 

•	The green play button on the top on the program. 

•	Note: the structure of the question MUST 
•	remain the same but you could always change the keyword or synonym! 
•	Eg How many lectures are there? keyword “lectures”
•	how many topics are there?   synonym topics 
•	If this is not fulfilled then the program would be asking you to “teach me” because the structure of the sentence changes. In this design only the synonym or keyword changes but the question still remains the same.
ALSO! You can only search with the maximum of two keywords!
